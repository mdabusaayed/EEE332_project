• A smart robotic system that can observe the temperature, moisture etc. condition of soil that is beneficial for cultivation. 
• We observe these conditions using this robotic system for the purpose of reduce sensor numbers over land. It’s a very flexible system and not very complex. 
• This robot can survey over the land & collect data from different corner of the land. For this reason, we can reduce the use of same sensors more and more. 
• A Bluetooth system notify about data instantly that helps farmers to know about the condition of land. 
• A very friendly android app is used to maintain the system and monitored data of the sensors by a farmer smoothly. 
• An enough flexible system that can be modified (code) by any developer instantly. 
• We will use only one sensor array/ prototype for the whole field.  
• It will transmit data instantly. 
• It’s an automatic system that need not to turn on whole period of time. It will start collecting data after a certain period.
